# Conceptual Model

Evaporation is the balance of energy availability, diffusion limits, and water availability

Since water is stored at different places within the system, that will have different storage, diffusion and energy availability, evaporation is computed  in multipe places

## Storage
[[Canopy water storage]]

[[Litter wtaer storage]]

Soil water storage

Detention Storage

## Energy


## Diffuse 
	### atmospheric conductance
