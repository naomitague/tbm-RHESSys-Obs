alias:: [transpiration, plant water loss], T

# # Description/Conceptual model
Transpiration is the process by which water is transported from the soil by plant roots through vascular structure of the stem, and eventually lost to the atmosphere as vapor through stomata. It is driven by available energy, water and diffusion gradients  and regulated by plant stomatal function.  Available energy at the leaf surface varies with leaf albedo, angle and distribution and incoming radiation from the atmosphere. Water availability depends on water storage in soil and sometime groundwater and root distribution access to that storage. Diffusion gradients depend on vapor pressure deficit and windspeed.  The model accounts for differential radiation exposure sunlit and shaded leaves separately and integrates modifiers from stomatal conductance, boundary layer conductance, and available radiation.

# Model Name (as implemented in the target ESM if there is a standard name e.g Penman monteith)
Penman-Monteith equation

# Equation as used in target ESM
\[ E = \frac{\Delta (R_n - G) + \rho_a c_p \text{VPD} / r_a}{\Delta + \gamma (1 + r_s/r_a)} \]

Where:
- \( E \): transpiration (mm/day)
- \( \Delta \): slope of saturation vapor pressure curve
- \( R_n \): net radiation
- \( G \): soil heat flux (often 0 for daily timestep)
- \( \rho_a \): air density
- \( c_p \): specific heat of air
- VPD: vapor pressure deficit
- \( r_a \): aerodynamic resistance
- [[process_stomatal_conductance]]\( r_s \): surface resistance (includes stomatal conductance)
- \( \gamma \): psychrometric constant
