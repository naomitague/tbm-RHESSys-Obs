alias:: [gs, stomatal conductance]

# Conceptual model
Stomatal conductance is the rate of  water and carbon exchange between the leaf and surrounding air through small pores in the leaf called stomates. The exchange is a diffusive process and thus varies with gradients (in water, O2 and CO2) and energy. However, the stomates  can open and close to  regulate this rate.  Stomatal conductance (gₛ) is modeled in RHESSys using a Jarvis-type multiplicative approach. where a species specific maximum value (gs_max) is scalaed based on environmental modifiers for light (PPFD), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), air temperature, CO₂ concentration, and root access to water via leaf water potential.

# Model Name (as implemented in the target ESM if there is a standard name e.g Penman monteith)
Jarvis multiplicative stomatal conductance model (after Jarvis 1976, via BIOME-BGC formulation)

# Equation as used in target ESM
gₛ = gₛ_max × f(PAR) × f(CO₂) × f(VPD) × f(Ψ_leaf) x f(t_avg) x f(t_min) * LAI * stomtal_fraction

Where:
- gₛ_max: maximum stomatal conductance (vegetation-specific)
- f(PAR): function of photosynthetically active radiation
- f(CO₂): scalar for CO₂ effect 
- f(VPD): vapor pressure deficit modifier
- [[process_stomatal_conductance_leaf_water_potential_response|f(LWP)]]: function of leaf water potential (soil-moisture mediated)
- f(t_avg) function of daily average air temperature
- f(t_min) function of minimum daily air temperature
- LAI - leaf area index
- stomatal_fraction - density of stomates on the leaf

# Limitations of process implementation used in target ESM
- Assumes one-to-one immediate stomatal response; does not capture dynamic stomatal lag or hysteresis.
- CO₂ response is  non-functional 
- Leaf-level conductance is simplified into sun/shade averages, reducing within-canopy variation.
- No nutrient control on gs, 
- Multiplicative model less mechanistic  - e.g it captures closure due to light availability but this happens because plants don't benefit from water loss in low light - so using A is more coupled - but it is then circular
- No climate acclimation of sensitivity to drivers (e.g t_avg)
