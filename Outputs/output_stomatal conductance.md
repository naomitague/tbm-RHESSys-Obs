# Description

Stomatal conductance is the rate of  water and carbon exchange between the leaf and surrounding air through small pores in the leaf called stomates. The exchange is a diffusive process and thus varies with gradients (in water, O2 and CO2) and energy. However, the stomates  can open and close to  regulate this rate.

Stomatal conductance cannot be measured directly but is inferred from a variety of approaches perhaps most directly through porometers,
