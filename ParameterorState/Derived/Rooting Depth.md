# Description

Rooting depth is the depth to which plant roots extend. It is often used to estimate water availability for the plant. A limitation of this approach is that it assumes that plants will have access over the entire profile defined by the depth. See discussion in [[Root water storage capacity]] and [[Soil Moisture - Root Accessible]].   Rooting depth also changes with time as plants grow, and can vary across species.  In carbon cycling models, rooting depth is a function of [[Root Carbon]].

Many models assume that rooting depth is fixed and does not valry through time (but does vary with species of plant functional type)

Dynamic rooting depth models can be linked with carbon


## 🌱 Root Depth Estimation from Root Carbon (Arora and Boer, 2003 )

For **trees**:
$$
z_{root} = \frac{3.0 \cdot \left( \frac{2.0 \cdot C_{root}}{\rho_{stem}} \right)^{rgd}}{rdp}
$$
For **non-trees**:

$$
z_{root} = \frac{3.0 \cdot \left( 2.0 \cdot C_{root} \right)^{rgd}}{rdp} 
$$

With post-processing constraints:

$$
z_{root}=min⁡(z_{root},z_{max_{root}},z_{soil})
$$

Uses uses direction and distribution of roots (that might vary by species) to translate ca

### ⚙️ Notes

- The multiplier **2.0** represents a fixed **biomass-to-carbon ratio**.
- For **trees**, root depth is scaled by the inverse of stem density to reflect allocation dynamics.

# Alternate way to effectively determine where roots are

Other approach partition a root carbon into a specific root surface area per carbon and then scale root water uptake from a given soil layer  by area of roots in each soil layer -


- Allocation favors shallower, wetter layers.

The weighting factor \( w_i \) is used to determine how root carbon is distributed across soil layers, favoring **shallower** and **wetter** layers 

$$
w_i = \left(1 - \frac{z_i}{Z_{max}}\right) \cdot \frac{\theta_i - \theta_{wilt}}{\theta_{ref} - \theta_{wilt}}
$$

**Where:**
- \( w_i \): Weighting factor for layer *i* (dimensionless)  
- \( z_i \): Depth to the center of soil layer *i* \([m]\)  
- \( Z_{max} \): Maximum rooting depth \([m]\)  
- \( \theta_i \): Volumetric soil moisture in layer *i* \([m^3\, m^{-3}]\)  
- \( \theta_{wilt} \): Wilting point soil moisture \([m^3\, m^{-3}]\)  
- \( \theta_{ref} \): Reference soil moisture (near field capacity) \([m^3\, m^{-3}]\)

**Principles:**
1. Shallower layers receive more allocation:
2. Wetter layers receive more allocation
