# Description

Field capacity is the water stored in soil (or other substrate) after gravity drainage. Field capacity depends on soil texture and chemical properties that control how tightly water is held against gravity.  It is usually measured as percent water by volume of soil (VWC) or as water tension ($\theta_{fc}$, $\psi_{fc}$. In some cases, relative saturation at field capacity is used (S_{fc}) - which is the % of available pore space filled at field capacity (rather than percent by volume of soil). Texture is often used to estimate field capacity (low values 15% VWC in sandy soils to high values 55% (VWC) in clay) - however actual field capacity can reflect soil heterogeneity and complicated soil structure

# Range

10 to 50% 
-10  to -30 kPa

# Function in the model

Determines how much water remains in the soil after gravity drainage - Plant water availability depends on water stored between field capacity and wilting point

# Sources

Field capacity in many hydrologic models is often assumed to vary with depth but remain static through time.  Estimating depth varying profiles remains challenging.

	# Summary

Field capacity depends on soil texture; Soil texture is often described as classes (sand, silt, clay) but can be modelled more physically by considering the distribution of pores through a pore-size index b,  [[pore_size_index]] and  $\psi_{ae}$ [[Psi_air_entry]].   Pedotransfer functions can be used to estimate field capacity as well as other soil hydraulic properties

RHESSys uses two formulations to compute **relative saturation at field capacity (S_fc)**, which is key in determining unsaturated zone water retention.


 Clapp & Hornberger (1978)
```math
S_{fc}(z) = \left( \frac{\psi_{ae}}{(z_s - z)} \right)^{b}
```

or 

 van Genuchten & Nielsen (1984)
```math
Sfc(z)=1−(zs−zψae)bS_{fc}(z) = 1 - \left( \frac{z_s - z}{\psi_{ae}} \right)^{b} 
```

where

- **ψₐₑ**: [[Psi_air_entry]]
    
- **z_s**: depth to water table
    
- **z**: depth variable
    
- **b**: [[pore_size_index]]

More recent research also highlights conditions where field capacity may change at relatively short (annual-decadal)
 time scales - Most hydrologic models do not account for time-varying field capacity (although ecohydrologic models will account for changing field capacity with depth and account for variation. in plant accessible field capacity as rooting depth change)
