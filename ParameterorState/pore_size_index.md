# Description

Represents the distribution of pore sizes in a soil and controls the shape of the soil water retention curve. A key parameter in both the Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten models. High values indicate a narrow range of pore sizes (e.g., sands); low values indicate a wide range (e.g., clays).

# Range

Typical values:

- Sands: \~4 to 8
- Loams: \~2 to 4
- Clays: \~0.5 to 2

# Function in the model

Used in RHESSys for defining the shape of the unsaturated water retention curve and influences both the drainage rate and water holding capacity. Determines how rapidly soils release water under decreasing matric potential.

# Summary
```

Controlled by soil texture and structure. Sandy soils with uniform large pores exhibit high b-values, while fine-textured or aggregated soils have low b-values due to a wider range of pore sizes.
