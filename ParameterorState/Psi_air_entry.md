# Description

Matric potential (or suction)** at which **air first begins to enter the largest water-filled pores** during soil drying. Often based on soil texture - but actual soils / substrates may be include other structural properties and textural heterogeneity

# Range

Sands -10--20 kp
Clays -100 to -300

# Function in the model

# Sources
	# Databases
Rarely measured directly usually inferred from pedotransfer functions, there are a few databases with measurements - see [[Soil Hydraulic Parameters]] for databases with pedotransfer functions

	# Summary


 Related to capillary forces created by pore space (particularly the largest pores because they generally hold water at less tension). See Jurin'Law that relates pore radius and tension
