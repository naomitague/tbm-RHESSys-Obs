**hydro/compute_rain_stored

# Variable Name
stratum.rain_stored

# Code in which its used

# Conceptual model

Depends on the balance between  water storage capacity Per lai, evaporation and water input (water inputs )

 drivers of evaporation (radiation, wind) vary with canopy layers

water inputs vary with cnaopy layers

# Parameters

specific_rain_capacity
specific_snow_capacity
